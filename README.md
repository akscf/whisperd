    Lightweight server with unified web API for various whisper implementations.<br>
    This module was written to divide Freeswitch and ASR things to launch the last one on a more suitable hardware.<br>
    The modules that able to interact with this server: <a href="https://github.com/akscf/mod_openai_asr">mod_openai_asr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/akscf/mod_curl_asr">mod_curl_asr</a>.<br>

<strong>***<br>As well as mod_whisper_asr this also crashes (and seems by the same reason) but not at once, it manage to process several requests...</strong>

<br>

### Version 1.0 (old version)
Capable to work only with whisper_cpp and have some issues...
- support MP3 / WAV (only single channel) files
- compatibility with OpenAI v1 http-api
- some extra parameters for tuning the whisper for a certain request

### Version 2.0
- supports the latest version of whisper_cpp (10.06.2024)<br> 
  with cpu/gpu and other features (see: mod-whisper-cpp)
- mp3/wav files<br>
 
Building the whisperd:<br>
 Let's say the installation path be: /opt/whisperd
 The server depends on following: <br>
 1) mpg123-1.32.3 or later <br>
    if you have already this in your system just correct MPG123_INC and MPG123_LIB in the Makefile <br>
    otherwise download and install it, if you don't want to dirty your systrem just copy libmpg123.so and libsyn123.so into '/opt/whisperd/lib' <br>
    and headers files into '/opt/whisperd/include/libmpg123' and '/opt/whisperd/include/libsyn123'. <br>

 2) libwstk (download the latest version from here: [wstk_c](https://github.com/akscf/wstk_c)) <br>
    unpack and 'make clean all', after, copy libwstk.so into '/opt/whisperd/lib' and headers to '/opt/whisperd/include/wstk' <br>
 
 Well, try to build the whisperd itself: 'make clean all install' <br>
 and if everything goes well all the necessary files will be copied to '/opt/whispers'. <br>
 The main configuration file is 'whisperd-conf.xml' (placed at: /opt/whispers/configs). <br>

Building the modules, in particular 'mod-whisper-cpp' : <br>
 This is the main module which works with whisper_cpp, if you have already installed the one <br>
 just correct its paths in 'mod-whisper-cpp/Makefile' (LIBWHISPER_INC and LIBWHISPER_LIB) otherwise <br>
 donwload and install it (and models too, for examle into: /opt/whisper_cpp/models). <br>
 After that the same as above: 'make clean all install', if successful you'll get 'mode-whisper-cpp.so' (at: /opt/whisperd/lib/mods)
 and the configuration 'mod-whisper-cpp-conf.xml' (at: /opt/whispers/configs), cpu/gpu and other settings tuned there. <br>

One more thing, each modules binds its own 'endpoint' (this is a virtual path that gives access to the module via web), you can change it in: 'whisperd-conf.xml' <br>

The whisper additional parameters can be specified trgouth the field 'opts': -F opts="{\"language\":\"en\"}" <br>
Available options: language=XX, tokens=N, translate=true/false, single=true/false<be>
 

## Example build with docker

```bash
# build container
docker build . -t whisperd:latest
# run container
docker run -p8080:8080 \
   -e 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/whisperd/lib:/opt/whisper_cpp/lib' \
   -it --rm --name whisperd whisperd:latest
```
